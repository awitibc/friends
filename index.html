        <h1>What are friends?</h1>
        <p>Friendship means familiar and liking of each other's mind.

            People who are friends talk to each other and spend time together. They trust one 
            another and also help each other when they are in trouble or are hurt. Friends 
            are people that can be looked up to and trusted. Usually friends have similar interests.
             A friend is one who admires a person's skill and helps or encourages them to make the 
             right choices and do not get into any trouble at all.
            
            The strength of the bond of friendship between two people can vary. If the bond is very 
            strong, they are called best friends. This can usually be achieved by possessing the 
            elements of friendship, by being kind, generous, loyal, honest and by having fun. 
            With these qualities you can truly enjoy the bliss of friendship.
            
            There are expectations, demands and complaints in friendship too. If friends don't match 
            with your expectations, it does not mean you will break the friendship. It is all about 
            understanding, realizing and helping whenever possible.
            
            Friendship is both good and necessary. Man cannot live all alone. He is a social being.
             He needs someone to share his joys and sorrows. Generally, it is only people of similar
              age, character and background, mentality, etc., who can understand him and his problems. 
              Friends are needed for support and for sharing.

             <h2>What are the different types of friendships?</h2>
             <p>Childhood,

                Childhood friends
                The understanding of friendship in children tends to be more heavily focused on areas
                 such as common activities, physical proximity, and shared expectations.These friendships
                  provide opportunity for playing and practicing self-regulation.  Most children tend to
                   describe friendship in terms of things like sharing, and children are more likely 
                   to share with someone they consider to be a friend. As children mature, they become
                    less individualized and are more aware of others. They gain the ability to 
                    empathize with their friends, and enjoy playing in groups. They also experience 
                    peer rejection as they move through the middle childhood years. Establishing good
                     friendships at a young age helps a child to be better acclimated in society
                      later on in their life.
                
                Based upon the reports of teachers and mothers, 75% of preschool children had at least one
                 friend. This figure rose to 78% through the fifth grade, as measured by co-nomination as 
                 friends, and 55% had a mutual best friend.[4]: 247  About 15% of children were found to
                  be chronically friendless, reporting periods without mutual friends at least six months.
                 
                
                Potential benefits of friendship include the opportunity to learn about empathy and problem 
                solving.[7] Coaching from parents can be useful in helping children to make friends.
                 Eileen Kennedy-Moore describes three key ingredients of children's friendship formation: 
                 (1) openness, (2) similarity, and (3) shared fun. Parents can also help children understand
                  social guidelines they haven't learned on their own. Drawing from research by Rober
                  t Selman and others, Kennedy-Moore outlines developmental stages in children's 
                  friendship, reflecting an increasing capacity to understand others' perspectives: 
                  "I Want It My Way", "What's In It For Me?", "By the Rules", "Caring and Sharing", 
                  and "Friends Through Thick and Thin."</p>
                  <P>Adolescence,

                     friendships become "more giving, sharing, frank, supportive,
                     and spontaneous." Adolescents tend to seek out peers who can provide such qualities
                      in a reciprocal relationship, and to avoid peers whose problematic behavior suggest
                       they may not be able to satisfy these needs.[14] Personal characteristics and 
                       dispositions are also features sought by adolescents, when choosing whom to 
                       begin a friendship with.[15] Relationships begin to maintain a focus on 
                       shared values, loyalty, and common interests, rather than physical concerns
                        like proximity and access to play things that more characterize childhood.6 
                    
                    A study performed at the University of Texas at Austin examined over 9,000 American
                     adolescents to determine how their engagement in problematic behavior (such as stealing,
                      fighting, and truancy) was related to their friendships. Findings indicated that
                       adolescents were less likely to engage in problem behavior when their friends
                       # did well in school, participated in school activities, avoided drinking, and had
                        good mental health. The opposite was found regarding adolescents who did engage
                         in problematic behavior. Whether adolescents were influenced by their friends
                          to engage in problem behavior depended on how much they were exposed to those 
                          friends, and whether they and their friendship groups "fit in" at school.
                    
                    A study by researchers from Purdue University found that friendships formed 
                    during post-secondary education last longer than friendships formed earlier.In late
                     adolescence cross-racial friendships tend to be uncommon, likely due to prejudice
                      and cultural differences.</P>
                      <P>Adulthood,

                        
                        
                        Freundschaft zwischen Jonathan und David by Julius Schnorr von 
                        Karolsfeld (1860), which translates in English as Friendship between 
                        Jonathan and David
                        
                        Two friends before posing for a picture.
                        Friendship in adulthood provides companionship, affection, as well as
                         emotional support, and contributes positively to mental well-being
                          and improved physical health.
                        
                        Adults may find it particularly difficult to maintain meaningful friendships
                         in the workplace. "The workplace can crackle with competition, so
                          people learn to hide vulnerabilities and quirks from colleagues
                          . Work friendships often take on a transactional feel; it is 
                          difficult to say where networking ends and real friendship begins.
                           Most adults value the financial security of their jobs more than 
                           friendship with coworkers.
                        
                        The majority of adults have an average of two close friends.
                         Numerous studies with adults suggest that friendships and other
                          supportive relationships do enhance self-esteem.</P>
                          <P>Older adults,
                            Older adults continue to report high levels of personal satisfaction 
                            in their friendships as they age, even as the overall number of friends 
                            tends to decline. This satisfaction is associated with an increased ability 
                            to accomplish activities of daily living, as well as a reduced decline in
                             cognitive abilities, decreased instances of hospitalization,
                              and better outcomes related to rehabilitation.
                               The overall number of reported friends in later life may be
                                mediated by increased lucidity, better speech and vision,
                                 and marital status.[23]: 53  A decline in the number of friends
                                  an individual has as they become older has been explained by
                                   Carstensen's Socioemotional Selectivity Theory,
                                    which describes a change in motivation that adults 
                                    experience when socializing. The theory states
                                     that an increase in age is characterized by a 
                                     shift from information-gathering to emotional
                                      regulation; in order to maintain positive emotions, 
                                      older adults restrict their social groups to those whom 
                                      they share an emotional bond.
                            
                            As one review phrased it:
                            
                            Research within the past four decades has now consistently found that 
                            older adults reporting the highest levels of happiness and general well
                             being also report strong, close ties to numerous friends.
                            
                            As family responsibilities and vocational pressures lessen, friendships
                             become more important. Among the elderly, friendships can provide links 
                             to the larger community, serve as a protective factor against depression
                              and loneliness, and compensate for potential losses in social support
                               previously given by family members.
                                 Especially for people who cannot go out as often, 
                               interactions with friends allow for continued societal interaction.
                                Additionally, older adults in declining health who remain in contact
                                 with friends show improved psychological well-being.</P>
